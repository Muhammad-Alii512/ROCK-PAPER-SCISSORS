- 🤖 Random computer choice generation
- 📊 Real-time score tracking
- 🎨 Clean and responsive UI

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **HTML** – Structure of the game
- **CSS (Flexbox)** – Styling and layout
- **JavaScript (ES6)** – Game logic and DOM manipulation

---

## 🧠 Programming Approach

This project is built using **modular programming** in JavaScript:

- Separate functions for each responsibility
  - `genCompChoice()` → generate computer move
  - `drawGame()` → handle draw condition
  - `showWinner()` → update score & UI
  - `playGame()` → main game logic
- Clean separation of concerns
- Readable and maintainable code

This approach makes the code easier to understand, debug, and extend.
